# NestReset

**Take back control of your Nest.**  
A dead-simple local web utility to flash the official Nest reset file and remove remote account locks.

---

## ✨ What is this?

**nestReset** is a local HTML-based tool that allows users to:

- Connect their Nest device via USB  
- Select the internal storage folder  
- Upload a `.dropbox` reset file  
- Regain full control of their Nest thermostat  

This is the same method used by Google when remotely resetting devices.

## 🔒 Why?

Some landlords, institutions, or admins remotely lock down Nest devices—blocking user control, restricting temperature modes, or changing settings without consent.

**[nestReset](https://vladimir-0001.github.io/nestreset/)** exists to restore control to the person who actually lives with the device.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project is about **user autonomy**.  
If you live with the hardware, **you should control it**.  
No remote admin should have permanent control over your thermostat.
